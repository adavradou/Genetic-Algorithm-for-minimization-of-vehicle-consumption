# Use-of-Genetic-Algorithms-for-the-minimization-of-a-vehicle-s-consumption

This code was created when I was a member of the TUCER team (http://www.tucer.tuc.gr/el/archiki/).

The idea is to feed the Simulink model with various velocity profiles and evaluate its output (the fuel consumption). The alteration of the velocity profiles, in order to achieve the minimization of the output, is achieved using Genetic Algorithms.

A Simulink model is required, in order for the code to run. Unfortunately, I cannot release the teamâ€™s Simulink model.
Run main.m in order to test the code.
